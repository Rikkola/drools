DecisionTableAnalysisOfTable0FinishedWithNoMessagesToBeReported=Decision Table Analysis of table '%s' finished with no messages to be reported.
SkippedDecisionTableAnalysisOfTable0Because1=Skipped Decision Table Analysis of table '%s' because: %s
SkippedDecisionTableAnalysisOfTable0HitPolicyPriorityMaskRulesForRules01AsTheyDefineMultipleInputentries=Skipped Decision Table Analysis of table '%s' hit policy Priority mask rules for rules: %s %s as they define multiple inputentries
Rule0Defines1WhichIsOutsideTheDomainMinMax2OfColumn3=Rule %s defines %s which is outside the domain min/max %s of column %s
GapDetected0=Gap detected: %s
ColumnsoRelateToFEELStringValuesWhichCanBeEnumeratedForTheInputsGapAnalysisSkipped=Columns: %s relate to FEEL string values which can be enumerated for the inputs; Gap analysis skipped.
OverlapObserved0=Overlap observed: %s
OverlapDetected0UNIQUEHitPolicyDecisionTablesCanOnlyHaveOneMatchingRule=Overlap detected: %s. UNIQUE hit policy decision tables can only have one matching rule.
OverlapDetected0ANYHitPolicyDecisionTablesAllowsMultipleRulesToMatchButTheyMustAllHaveTheSameOutput=Overlap detected: %s. ANY hit policy decision tables allows multiple rules to match, but they [must] all have the same output
DecisionTable0UsesFIRSTHitPolicyFIRSTHitPolicyDecisionTablesAreNotConsideredGoodPracticeBecauseTheyDoNotOfferAClearOverviewOfTheDecisionLogicQuotedFromDecisionModelAndNotationSpecification=Decision Table '%s' uses FIRST hit policy. FIRST hit policy decision tables are not considered good practice because they do not offer a clear overview of the decision logic (quoted from: Decision Model and Notation specification)

Rule0IsAMisleadingRuleItCouldBeMisleadingOverOtherRulesSuchAsRule0=Rule %s is a misleading rule. It could be misleading over other rules, such as rule: %s
SubsumptionRule0ContainsRule0RulesCanBeContractedByKeepingRule1AndErasingRule2=Subsumption: Rule %s contains rule: %s; rules can be contracted, by keeping rule %s and erasing rule %s
ContractionRules0CanBeCombinedForContractionByJoiningOnInput1=Contraction: Rules %s can be combined for contraction by joining on input %s
FirstNormalFormViolationHitPolicyFirstIsAViolationOfFirstNormalFormConsiderChangingForExampleToPriority=First Normal Form Violation: hit policy First is a violation of First Normal Form; consider changing for example to Priority
FirstNormalFormViolationHitPolicyRuleOrderIsAViolationOfFirstNormalFormConsiderChangingForExampleToOutputOrderOrCollect=First Normal Form Violation: hit policy Rule Order is a violation of First Normal Form; consider changing for example to Output Order or Collect
FirstNormalFormViolationRules0AreDuplicates=First Normal Form Violation: Rules %s are duplicates
SecondNormalFormViolationInput0IsIrrelevantForRules0ConsiderCombiningTheseRulesOverTheIrrelevantInput=Second Normal Form Violation: Input %s is irrelevant for rules %s. Consider combining these rules over the irrelevant input
TheHitPolicyForDecisionTable0ShouldBeUNIQUE=The HitPolicy for decision table '%s' should be UNIQUE
OverlappingRulesHaveTheSameOutputValueSoTheHitPolicyForDecisionTable0ShouldBeANY=Overlapping rules have the same output value, so the HitPolicy for decision table '%s' should be ANY
OverlappingRulesHaveDifferentOutputValueSoTheHitPolicyForDecisionTable0ShouldBePRIORITY=Overlapping rules have different output value, so the HitPolicy for decision table '%s' should be PRIORITY
